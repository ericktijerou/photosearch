## Get Your Flickr API Key ðŸ”‘

In order to fetch data from Flickr you'll need to get your API Key from the following URL: [https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/?](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/?)<br>

Now that you have a key you'll need to include it in `apikey.properties`

```
flickrKey=\"YOUR_API_KEY\"
userId=\"YOUR_FLICKR_USER_ID\"
```
